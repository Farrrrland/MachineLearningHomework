# MachineLearningHomework

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Farrrrland/MachineLearningHomework/HEAD)

This repo is for programming homework of COMP5212 Machine Learning in HKUST

`./BinaryClassification` is the first programming homework with simple hand written images classification using logistic regression and SVM.

`./CIFAR10Classifier` is the second programming homework, using neural network for cifar-10 dataset.

`./LSTM` is the third programming homework, we  implement a sequence model with a bidirectional LSTM to conduct sentiment analysis on SST-2 dataset with postive and negative sentiments. Note that due to the severe version conflict of the packages from the given language preprocessing demo code using `torchtext`, this project is inplemented in through repo2dcker with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). See the project for more details.
